## 0.6.0
- Three variables: `fmsl.space` computes exact fluid states of rational functions of x, y, z.
- Exact range of two-variable rational functions over a square or the plane (`fmsl.plane`).
- Signed ranges (+oo and -oo kept apart); all 21 examples of Dinh-Guo-Nguyen-Pham (2022)
  reproduced, including the curve case they left open.
- Independent cross-checks: loop (2-D) and cube (3-D) images; mutation tests.
- Faster exact arithmetic: cached integer Sturm sequences, continued-fraction rationals.

## 0.5.0
- Exact fluid-state arcs (cluster sets), resolution stopping rule, bifurcation stability.

## 0.4.0
- Exact real algebraic numbers, two-variable fluid states, bifurcations, sampling study.
